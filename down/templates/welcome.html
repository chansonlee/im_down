  SlideThru makes sure you'll always have something to do on a Friday night.
  <br>
  With SlideThru, you can post hangout proposals to all of your friends, <br> all at the same time.
  Never again suffer from friends who aren't free <br> and make plan rejections a thing of the past.
  When friends want to hang, <br> they'll press your post's "slide through" button and you'll know who's REALLY down.<br><br> It's that easy. <br><br>
